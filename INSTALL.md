# Released raw data
We release the following datasets and tool under the MIT License:

* Decca, our dependency issue assessment tool, which is implemented as a Maven plugin to warn developers whether the issues are benign or harmful. You can find it in package **plugin-decca.zip**, which contains the following files and directories:

> (1) File **decca-1.0.jar** is a copy of Decca‘s implementation for running analysis tasks.

> (2)	File **decca-1.0.pom** is the pom file (project object model) of Decca project.

> (3)	File **soot-1.0.jar** is a program static analysis tool referenced by Decca.

> (4)	The directory **apache-maven-3.2.5** is the Maven project. As Decca is a Maven plugin, its implementation depends on Maven project.

> (5)	File **script.jar** is the script for evaluating the experimental results shown in Section 5.1. With the help of this script, analyzing the ground truth dataset can be run in batch mode.

*	Raw data we used in our experiments(Section 5). You can find raw datasets in package **RawData.zip** which is available at:
https://we.tl/PiShDzvpaF 

The package **RawData.zip** contains the following two parts of data:

> (a)	The ground truth dataset used to verify the effectiveness of Decca (Section 5.1). You can find it in package **RawData\Ground truth dataset.zip**, which contains the following files and directories:

>>(1)	File **Ground truth dataset.xlsx** provides the explanation for the dataset.

>>(2)	The directory **RawData\Release_conflict** contains the collected host projects with 43 high-severity and 176 low-severity dependency issues.

>>(3)	The directory **RawData\Release_fixed** contains the above host projects whose high- severity dependency issues have been fixed.
Running Decca on **RawData\Release_conflict** and **RawData\Release_fixed** can reproduce our experimental results described in Section 5.1.

> (b)	24 Java projects we analyzed to verify the usefulness of Decca (Section 5.2). In package **RawData\Issue report dataset.zip**, you can find the following files and directories:

>>(1)	File Issue report **dataset\Reports.docx** lists the links of dependency conflict issue reports we submitted to their corresponding bug tracking systems(in Section 5.2).

>>(2)	The directory **Issue report dataset\Projects** contains the 24 subjects with dependency conflict issues.

>>(3)	The directory **Issue report dataset\Generated issue reports** contains the issue reports generated by Decca.

Running Decca on them can reproduce our experimental results described in Table 3 of Section 5.2.

# How to use Decca
Decca can take a Maven based project (it should contain the complete Maven built project directory and file pom.xml) as input for analysis. The expected running environment is 64-bit Window operating system with JDK 1.7 or 1.8. **As Maven built projects need to download dependencies from Maven Central Repository, Decca cannot work offline.**

You can run Decca on our experimental subjects based on the following steps:
**Step 1**: Unzip the plugin-decca.zip to local directory. Recommended directory structure is:
D:\plugin-decca
     ├─decca-1.0.jar : 
     
     ├─decca-1.0.pom
   
     ├─soot-1.0.jar
    
     ├─apache-maven-3.2.5
   
     ├─script.jar
